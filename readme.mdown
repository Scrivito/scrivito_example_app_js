# Scrivito Example App JS

[![CMS: Scrivito](https://img.shields.io/badge/CMS-Scrivito-brightgreen.svg)](https://scrivito.com) [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) [![Travis build status](https://img.shields.io/travis/Scrivito/scrivito_example_app_js.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/Scrivito/scrivito_example_app_js) [![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/Scrivito/scrivito_example_app_js.svg)](https://github.com/Scrivito/scrivito_example_app_js) [![GitHub top language](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/Scrivito/scrivito_example_app_js.svg)](https://github.com/Scrivito/scrivito_example_app_js)

This is a showcase app, how [Scrivito](https://scrivito.com) is working as a JavaScript application.

## Prerequisites

* [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= 8.0.0
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) >= 5.0.0 (already part of nodejs 8.x).

Now simply call `npm install` in the commandline to install all js dependencies (which are places in the folder `node_modules/`).

## Specify the Scrivito CMS to use

The ScrivitoJS example app requires the tenant ID of your CMS. The ID is read from the environment variable `SCRIVITO_TENANT`. The environment variable can also be set via [`.env`](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv).

To specify it, proceed as follows:

* Go to your [Scrivito account](https://my.scrivito.com/account).
* If you don’t have a CMS, create one.
* Navigate to your [CMS instances](https://my.scrivito.com/tenants).
* Click the CMS to use.
* Open the “Settings” tab.
* Scroll down to the “API Keys” section.
* Copy the value after SCRIVITO_TENANT= to the clipboard.
* In the project directory, open/create the file `.env` and paste the ID after the `SCRIVITO_TENANT` key. The file should then look like this:

```
SCRIVITO_TENANT=0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF
```

See `.env.example` for an concrete example.

## Set the CORS origin(s)

To enable resource sharing between your CMS and your web application, specify the URL of your app in the CMS settings.

* Like above, navigate to the “Settings” tab of the CMS to use with your app.
* Scroll down to the “Development” section.
* Click “Edit” to change the additional CORS origins and add the local URL under which your app will be accessed: `http://localhost:8080`.

## How to build/compile

Calling `npm run build` will compile all js, html and css and place it in the `build/` folder.

## How to develop

Calling `npm start` will start a webserver, which listens to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) and opens that site in your browser. It should also automatically reload the page, once changes to the code (in `src/`) have been made.
