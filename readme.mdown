# Scrivito Example App JS

> **üìç Development has moved forward!** This repository remains a valuable resource for getting familiar with Scrivito implementation patterns, but active development now focuses on the new **[Scrivito Portal App](https://github.com/Scrivito/scrivito-portal-app)** featuring data integration, a modern build environment with full TypeScript support, and a lot more.

[Scrivito](https://www.scrivito.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=natural&utm_campaign=github_example_app) is the world's most secure, serverless JavaScript CMS. Based on ReactJS, it is completely maintenance-free, cost-effective, and has unprecedented security. Learn more about Scrivito at [scrivito.com](https://www.scrivito.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=natural&utm_campaign=github_example_app).

This example app shows Scrivito‚Äôs features and is a great basis for your own Scrivito website projects.

## Features

Scrivito is a SaaS Content Management Service, built for digital agencies and medium to large sized businesses.

It is the only CMS that combines unmatched WYSIWYG usability for editors with maximum flexibility for developers ‚Äì because it is at the forefront of the current [JavaScript web development revolution](https://www.webdevelopmentrevolution.com/).

And because Scrivito is 100% serverless, you'll never have to patch your CMS, so it's the most secure and cost-effective solution on the market.

## Getting Started

Sign up for a free trial at [my.scrivito.com/signup](https://my.scrivito.com/signup?utm_source=github&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=github_example_app).

Once you have a Scrivito tenant, it's time to do some development.

### Clone repository

```
git clone https://github.com/Scrivito/scrivito_example_app_js.git

cd scrivito_example_app_js/
```

### Install/check prerequisites

Make sure that you have [![node ‚â• 18.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/node-‚â•%2018.0-blue.svg)](https://nodejs.org) installed.

```
node -v
# should output something like v18.17.0
```

### Install dependencies

Now simply call `npm install` in the command line to install all JS dependencies (which are placed in the folder `node_modules/`).

### Specify the Scrivito CMS to use

The Scrivito example app JS requires the tenant ID of your CMS. The ID is taken from the environment variable `SCRIVITO_TENANT`. The environment variable can also be set via [`.env`](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv).

To specify it, proceed as follows:

- Go to your [Scrivito Websites](https://my.scrivito.com/tenants/).
- Click the CMS to use.
- Open the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù tab.
- Scroll down to the ‚ÄúAnonymous access for the Scrivito Javascript SDK‚Äù section.
- Copy the value after SCRIVITO_TENANT= to the clipboard.
- In the project directory, open/create the file `.env` and paste the ID after the `SCRIVITO_TENANT` key. The file should then look like this:

```
SCRIVITO_TENANT=0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF
```

See `.env.example` for an example.

### Set other authorized URLs

To enable resource sharing between your CMS and your web application, specify the URL of your app in the CMS settings.

- Like above, navigate to the ‚ÄúDeployment‚Äù tab of the CMS to use with your app.
- Make sure that `http://localhost:8080` is added to the "Other authorized URLs".

See [Getting Started with ScrivitoJS](https://scrivito.com/getting-started-with-scrivitojs-f729f073bf4672d8) for more information.

## How to develop

Calling `npm start` will start a webserver, which listens to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) and opens this URL in your browser. It should also automatically reload the page after changes to the code (in `src/`) have been made.

## Your first change

To see development in action, let's change the `ButtonWidget` so that it prefixes all buttons with your favorite emoji.

Open up the react component responsible for rendering a `ButtonWidget`. It's located at `src/Widgets/ButtonWidget/ButtonWidgetComponent.js`. Now look for the `Scrivito.LinkTag` and insert

```jsx
{"üöÄ "}
```

before

```jsx
{text}<i className="fa fa-angle-right fa-4" aria-hidden="true" />
```

After saving the file, your browser should automatically reload [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) with your new emoji button. Of course you can choose another emoji, check out [emojipedia.org](https://emojipedia.org).

## How to generate page and widget classes

For having the scaffolds of new CMS object and widget classes conveniently created, a [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/)-based generator is included. It adds the folder and files needed as a minimum for a class to the project, and provides the basic code and configuration for it to work. For details on how to use the generator and what it effects, see [Using the Example App's Page and Widget Class Generator](https://www.scrivito.com/class-generator). For a quick start, run it like so:

```
npx yo scrivito
```

## How to build/compile

Calling `npm run build` will compile all JS, HTML and CSS and place it in the `build/` folder. It also creates a `build.zip` file, which can be deployed via [my.scrivito.com](https://my.scrivito.com).
